# WoodenFrequencyDomain
Frequency domain is made out of wood and looks like this:
![Wooden Frequency Domain](wooden_frequency_domain.png?raw=true "Wooden Frequency Domain")

The python code in WoodenFrequencyDomain.py just plots Frequency domain.

Take a look, try to run it, and suggest what we shall rebuid it with.
Do we need more modern material for it? The wood is pretty durable! 
It survived 200 ears (since Josef Fourier discovered it) and still looks like new!
